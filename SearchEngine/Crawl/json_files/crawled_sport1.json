["It was as nailed-on that there would be a Swiss player in the men\u2019s final of the 2017 Australian Open on Sunday as it was that an American would win the women\u2019s title on Saturday. The odds that their combined ages would be at least 70 were a little tougher to see at the start of the fortnight but it crystallized into stunning reality here on the 11th day of a tournament that has had more twists than the Melbourne Grand Prix.", "A few hours after Serena Williams, 35, joined her 36-year-old sister, Venus, in the women\u2019s final by trouncing the 34-year-old Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, Federer, 35, somehow conjured some more retro magic to beat Stan Wawrinka, a mere 31, for the 19th time in 22 matches. His bete noire, Rafael Nadal, plays Grigor Dimitrov, his young doppelganger, in the second semi-final on Friday.", "In so many ways, what Federer has done the past fortnight \u2013 and what he might do in his 100th match here, on Sunday \u2013 is beyond believable. When he forced a final weary shot out of his friend after a few ticks over three hours to win 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 6-3, Federer became the oldest man to reach the final of any major since Ken Rosewall at the 1974 US Open, when the Australian was 39. And the Swiss wizard has done it after six months off the Tour to recover from knee surgery. If he played on one leg, he could not amaze us much more.", "Federer took a medical timeout between the fourth and fifth sets and the faithful must have wondered if maybe he had come back too soon. When he returned to the court, he allayed their fears, battered Wawrinka and they rose to acclaim him as of old. They always believed he would.", "\u201cI\u2019ve had a leg thing going on for the week,\u201d he said courtside. \u201cI felt it from the second game of the match. I never take injury timeouts. I hope Stan wasn\u2019t mad.\u201d Wawrinka took one of his own, earlier. And he didn\u2019t look too mad when they embraced at the net.", "He was pressed to be more specific about the injury. \u201cIf you go off the court, the treatment is further up the leg. It\u2019s still the leg, right?\u201d And that, of course, went down like the best joke of the year.", "He added: \u201cI never, ever in my wildest dreams thought I\u2019d be coming this far in Australia.\u201d There were a few present who always held that dream close.", "Some people came to watch a tennis match on Thursday night. But it was easy to see why a lot of them were here for a religious experience, in adoration of the god they call Roger. It was as if the Rod Laver Arena was not big enough to house their devotion. He did not disappoint, although he did wobble.", "For a man who has the dress sense of your grandfather, he is to millions of tennis fans the coolest guy in sport. Just the coolest guy all round, really. He can do no wrong, even when he does, although he kept his unforced errors to a manageable 49. Novak Djokovic won a match here last year hitting a hundred of them.", "But Federer\u2019s mistakes are mere accidents that spring from his daring. It does not require blind faith to appreciate the special player that he has been, still is, and, for as long as he chooses or until someone lets the tyres down on his wheelchair, will continue to be. It is not just that he plays and looks magnificent carving the air with his racket, going for the winning shot whenever it presents itself. He also brings a panoply of gifts to his sport that have little to do with tennis.", "Federer shakes more hands and hugs more babies than a politician \u2013 and what a good one he might make. Then again, diplomacy, correctness and an obsession with honesty have always underpinned his excellence, so maybe he would be a lousy one.", "Wawrinka is earthier and built of different material. Brad Gilbert calls him \u201cthe Stanimal\u201d for a reason. On Thursday, he growled all the way to the end.", "Earlier they walked from the locker room together, Wawrinka a couple of yards and four years behind his compatriot, perhaps looking for the merest hint of physical slippage, but more likely lost in thought about his gameplan.", "How different things might have been, though. Before the match, the governor general, Peter Cosgrove, presented the nation\u2019s highest honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia, to Rod Laver in his eponymous arena. He has a statue outside too. The old boy, who has lived in the United States for many years, remains immensely proud of the country he was born in 78 years ago and comes home as often as he can.", "If Federer\u2019s parents had gone through with plans to emigrate to Australia when he was 13 the explosion of applause for him when he reached the 28th slam final of his career, and his sixth in Melbourne, would have been heard in Perth \u2013 Scotland, that is.", "There is, nevertheless, a lot of Australia in Federer. One of his earliest mentors was the South Australian Peter Carter, whose death in a 2002 car accident devastated him. His tears after winning here in the past have roots deeper than an attachment to victory.", "He has said more than once that he learned respect and a work ethic from Carter, whose family he seeks out on his annual visits. When he was going through a trough a few years ago, he joked that he had only got them tickets for the quarter-final as he was not sure he would progress much further.", "It is interesting to speculate what Federer the Australian would have become. As a precocious teenager, he was already moving \u2013 loudly and some times petulantly, it has to be said \u2013 towards a career in tennis. Might he also have tried cricket? He does like the game and almost certainly would have been a fine batsman. His maternal grandfather was a big noise in the Northern Transvaal Cricket Union.", "But Switzerland remained Roger\u2019s home. It is also his haven. For years he lived in quiet, conservative Bottmingen in Basel-Land. In 2014, he and Mirka and their four children moved into a \u00a36.5m mansion 70 miles away in Wollerau on the shores of Lake Zurich. Glass surrounds flood the residence with light, as if he did not generate enough himself.", "All of that was a long way from the battlefield in Melbourne. Federer had to fight harder than at any time since his return to subdue Wawrinka. When he dropped serve in the third set to go 1-4 down, it was the first time he had been broken since the second set against Mischa Zverev. When Wawrinka broke him again, anxiety spread in the congregation. When Stan served out the set to love, mild panic set in. Federer lost the fourth set too. The fans held their breath \u2013 then they voiced their wholesale delight when he slowly but inexorably worked his way to the finish line.", "Federer came from behind to beat Kei Nishikori in five sets in the fourth round. This was the 46th five-setter of his career, his second in four days. Wawrinka has played 45. One thing is certain. There will be one tired Swiss on court on Sunday."]["In perhaps the greatest and certainly least likely triumph of his career, Roger Federer defeated his nemesis Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open final, the Swiss clinching his 18th grand slam title and all but altering the space\u2011time continuum in a five-set classic at the Rod Laver Arena.", "With this breathtaking victory \u2013 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 in three hours and 37 minutes \u2013 Federer becomes the first man to take five or more titles at three grand slam events and, at 35, the second-oldest man behind Ken Rosewall to win a major singles trophy. Only the appearance of a wooden racket could have made it more surreal.", "The fifth set was full of agonising drama and Federer weathered two break points to serve it out \u2013 but his ethereal grace could not be denied. Coming as it does a full five years after his 17th crown, the sight of the great champion\u2019s tearful celebration was as pleasingly familiar as it was utterly astonishing. In future years he will surely look back on this ninth grand slam final meeting with his most fearsome opponent and wonder if it really happened.", "The early stages of the first set provided a familiar sight \u2013 both players trying to limit the damage wrought by the other\u2019s forehand weaponry. Federer, only the No17 seed here, was as balletic and graceful as ever and it stayed on serve until the seventh game \u2013 Nadal\u2019s fourth on serve \u2013 when Federer unfurled an unreturnable backhand and then an imperious forehand winner before achieving the first break.", "With economy of effort and an outswinging ace to seal it, Federer had taken the first set 6-4 in 34 minutes. Simply hanging in points had not been enough for Nadal. He trailed 13-5 for winners as the Swiss master went to work.", "By then the arena was packed with true believers but worship had not come cheap. A day earlier tickets were being hawked for up to A$16,000 (\u00a39,630) \u2013 more than it cost to buy a house in Melbourne when the guest of honour, Rod Laver, won his last title and quite a premium on their original price range of A$413 to A$662 (\u00a3248-\u00a3398).", "Nadal needed to return with energy and hope for some untimely break in Federer\u2019s effortless momentum in the second set. The two forces intersected to produce a pair of early break opportunities and the Spaniard struck. His battle to hold serve next up elevated the contest to fever pitch and Federer\u2019s error count was steadily building.", "As in the third set of his semi-final win against Stan Wawrinka, Federer was suddenly a shadow of the player who had been commanding the contest moments earlier and quickly trailed 4-0. Unlike that previous match, he refused simply to write off the set entirely, breaking back once and giving Nadal hell in some barnstorming rallies before conceding it 6-3 in 42 minutes.", "Federer mixed howlers with howitzers in an awkward, 10-minute long hold of serve to start the third set, then just as quickly returned to his virtuoso earlier self. He unfurled a series of mesmerising forehand winners to secure an early break and wedge his foot in the door. Nadal was still stoic and mean but dropped the set 6-1. Federer had hit 18 winners to Nadal\u2019s four and looked invincible once more.", "The No9 seed, though, was far from done. With a sizzling forehand winner down the line in the fourth game of the fourth set, he had three break points and took advantage. A sliced forehand winner to make it 4-1 in his favour bent logic and a tight angle to astound the Melbourne crowd. In 40 taut minutes Nadal had pushed it to a decider.", "The only surprise when Federer took a medical time-out before the fifth set was that neither battle-weary player had done so sooner. Hopping about energetically as he waited, Nadal was soon tucking into his opponent\u2019s serve, whip-cracking a signature forehand winner on his way to an early break.", "Then Federer rallied again. His effort to break back and lock it up at 3-3 came after several moments of unbearable drama as Nadal, seemingly possessed, met almost every break point with a winner. Back on level terms, now it was Nadal showing fatigue as he sent an exhausted double fault into the middle before conceding the final, fatal break.", "Almost prostrate 30 minutes previously, Federer weathered a number of nerve-shredding moments in his final service game but after an unsuccessful challenge from his opponent, finally saluted. By that point you had started to wonder whether 16-grand seats were not a bargain after all.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us believed we\u2019d be in the finals,\u201d Federer said afterwards before paying tribute to Nadal. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you. I would have been happy to lose, to be honest. The comeback was as perfect as it was.\u201d", "Nadal said: \u201cToday was a great match. Roger deserved it a bit more than me. I\u2019m just going to keep trying. I feel I am back at a very high level, so I\u2019m going to carry on fighting the whole season.\u201d", "The pointy end of this tournament taught us that sometimes the fountain of youth is actually a mirage. When the favourites Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray stumbled to shock losses in week one, it really should have been a newer-generation top-10 player such as Milos Raonic, Kei Nishikori or Dominic Thiem seizing this moment \u2013 or more likely battled-hardened Stan Wawrinka. Yet none had it in him. None had this in him.", "All the while Federer and Nadal were essentially playing from memory but what temples of sporting genius their minds and bodies are. Nadal has beaten Federer so many times over the years some hesitate to call it a rivalry. Here the only shame, as ever, was the need to split them. Performing at this level in your prime is one thing; doing it as the lights dim is the mark of untouchable greatness."]["Roger Federer will compete for his 18th grand slam singles title after defeating countryman Stan Wawrinka in a gripping five-set Australian Open semi-final at Rod Laver Arena.", "The world No17 triumphed 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 6-3 across three hours and five minutes in Melbourne, keeping alive the dream he might meet arch-rival Rafael Nadal in a retro-flavoured final.", "Once these two players shared a quite convivial master-apprentice relationship, but not for some time. \u201cThe day came where he didn\u2019t call me so much any more,\u201d Federer noted in the lead-up to this encounter. He also figured nobody in the world bar Nadal knew his game better.", "Knowing is one thing, delivering is another. Two sets down and limping, Wawrinka looked done. But his minor genius is to look flushed and mildly flustered at all times, like a man struggling through his first gym session in months, when he\u2019s actually as strong as an ox and resilient beyond expectation.", "\u201cIt was an awkward match. Always against Stan, it was always never going to be easy,\u201d Federer said afterwards. \u201c[I\u2019m] super happy I was able to win another five-setter in a grand slam. I don\u2019t know how many times I won two five-setters in a grand slam. Maybe never before. So this is big.\u201d", "The first set provided 50 minutes of utterly compelling tennis, Wawrinka looking the dominant force whenever a rally built but Federer defending with such light-footed brilliance it was always going to be hard to split them. ", "In football the cliche is that the best defensive team will always beat the best attacking one, and Federer\u2019s efforts to stay in points that looked doomed proved crucial in the first set. Typical was a defensive, half-volley backhand slice from mid-court early in proceedings, which had seemed a metre past him when he made contact.", "At 5-5 Wawrinka mustered a break point but was expertly manoeuvred from wing to wing and couldn\u2019t retrieve a running forehand, so Federer held. It seemed inconceivable a tie-break would be avoided, but serving at 5-6 Wawrinka blinked, losing his barings for all of a minute and letting his opponent slip through the back door. On set point Federer pushed him wide on the forehand and the world No4 cannoned it into the net to concede.", "The second set hinged on Wawrinka\u2019s third service game. Federer caressed a forehand winner to make it 30-0 and then found himself with two break points. Wawrinka saved one, then had Federer out-positioned in a rally, but advancing to mid-court he clattered a regulation backhand into the net and drew a mass intake of breath.", "Unable to break the offending racket by throwing it to the ground, Wawrinka calmly snapped it over his knee, as if to rid himself of its suddenly dark aura. It sat courtside as a reminder of the split-second errors that would define the result. With a clinical love service game Federer closed out the set in 31 minutes. ", "His head covered in a towel and wearing a pained expression, Wawrinka promptly left the arena for a medical time-out. Later he revealed his right knee had in fact troubled him for the past fortnight. \u201cIt\u2019s been for sure an issue since the beginning of the tournament,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cThen again, it\u2019s not an excuse at all.\u201d", "The world No4 returned with his right knee bandaged at the start of the third set, his shoulders slouched and his spirit sagging, but far bigger trouble was brewing for Federer. The inexplicable happened in Federer\u2019s second service game when he faded completely to cough up three break points. Wawrinka struck with the second, and made it a double break soon after. He took the set 6-1 in 26 minutes as Melburnians sat in stunned silence. It was like a perfectly executed burglary in a sleepy town.", "Wawrinka became far more obtrusive from there, breaking immediately in the fourth set by unfurling a wondrous cross-court backhand winner. Earlier in the match he\u2019d been given the runaround. Now it was time to stand and deliver. But nor was the four-time champion done, breaking straight back from a heart-stopping rally.", "The heightened stakes and rising din elevated the contest. Even on one good leg Wawrinka was a menace. It had looked destined for a tie-break but in the ninth game, with a deft forehand passing shot, Wawrinka broke and ensured a fifth set \u2013 still ruddy-faced and downbeat in his manner but playing with genuine swagger as he sealed it in 38 minutes.", "Now it was Federer\u2019s turn for medical treatment. Eight minutes on, wrapped in towels and trying to loosen fatigued limbs, Wawrinka looked none too pleased about the prospect of his body seizing up on him and burying his chances.", "Federer returned calm but the match went a little haywire. Wawrinka had a chance to break him in the fifth game of the decider but Federer dug in his heels, then broke serve himself after Wawrinka sent down an untimely double fault. The buffer proved insurmountable, and Federer triumphed with a polite pump of the fist and a quarter-smile suggesting a job half-done.", "\u201cI know I will have a chance to win on Sunday now,\u201d Federer said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great position to be in. Regardless of who it\u2019s going to be against, I think it\u2019s going to be special either way. One is going to go for his first slam or it\u2019s the epic battle with Rafa.\u201d", "Wawrinka paid tribute to his compatriot\u2019s late-career resurgence. \u201cHe\u2019s (an) amazing player to watch and to see on the court,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s flying on the court. He\u2019s playing amazing tennis. He\u2019s the best player ever. He can do anything he wants on the court.\u201d", "A confluence of events have aided this remarkable situation in which three players aged 35 or over have now qualified for their respective singles final, chief among them a spell of mild weather in Melbourne, and in the case of the men\u2019s draw the early exit of the two most fancied contenders. ", "But you don\u2019t stumble into a grand slam final. Federer forced his way in with brilliant tennis at the right time, just as sure as the Williams sisters did earlier in the day. That he\u2019s hovered near the top echelon for so long after his absolute prime is a statistical marvel of course, but that is nothing on the thrill of it in the flesh."]["Amazingly, irresistibly, beguilingly Roger Federer is playing tennis, five months short of his 36th birthday, that, apart from minor adjustments for age, is virtually indistinguishable from that which held his rivals transfixed for most of his 20s. It hardly seems possible but it is happening.", "There were plenty of observers, one of them not far from this keyboard, who doubted Federer could break the long spell he endured without a major after beating Andy Murray at Wimbledon in 2012. True believers in the press pack were confined to a knot of shameless sycophants.", "It did not make sense that Federer could break the strengthening duopoly of Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, even though the Swiss twice pushed the Serb close at Wimbledon, once in a classic final, in 2014. Rafael Nadal, too, from time to time was still in front of him. Federer resembled a fallen Hollywood star who kept auditioning for the same role while the greasepaint ran embarrassingly down his cheeks.", "But on Sunday evening, only a few hours after a chronically painful right elbow forced Djokovic to join Murray on the injured list and withdraw from the forthcoming Miami Open, the ageless Federer beat 31-year-old Stan Wawrinka to win the Indian Wells Open for a joint-record fifth time, 6-4, 7-5 in killing 34C heat over an hour and 20 minutes. It was as if he were rising again by sheer force of will.", "Religious miracles are oceans parting and the lame throwing away their sticks. In tennis the earthly equivalent is Federer taking six months out in 2016 to recover from knee surgery that might have spirited him into retirement and returning to win this year\u2019s Australian Open by coming from 1-3 down in the fifth set of the final, against Nadal, one of the game\u2019s brutal finishers.", "Not only has he broken his grand slam drought but he has blossomed like a cactus flower in the desert. Sunday\u2019s victory in a tournament the organisers like to regard as the fifth major was short of that. These were best-of-three matches and there were five of them, not seven over a maximum of five sets, as in the majors. And Federer had a walkover against Nick Kyrgios in the quarter-finals. Still Federer, who held serve 37 times in a row to reach the final, did what he had to do. He was quick, sharp, smart, adventurous and merciless. He floated again and stung.", "Federer is 19 short of the career collection of tournament victories of Jimmy Connors, who played in physically less demanding times. Connors quit tennis at 40. Federer, who said recently he might also play on until he is that age, began the week at No10 in the world but thinks he has an outside chance of returning to the top of the rankings, maybe even by the end of the year. There is gathering evidence to support a contention that seemed preposterous only a few months ago.", "Murray, the world No1 since clambering over the worryingly brittle Djokovic towards the end of last season, is still favourite to hold his lead all the way to Wimbledon, where he will defend the title he won for the second time last summer. He said on Saturday he plans to be fit for the Monte Carlo Open, which starts on 16 April, although he made no mention of his commitment to Great Britain\u2019s Davis Cup quarter-final against France in Rouen, which begins on 7 April.", "The Scot picked up his complaint during practice in Indian Wells \u2013 where he lost his opening match to the world No129, Vasek Posposil \u2013 but Djokovic\u2019s predicament, arising from a long-term problem that first surfaced after the French Open last year, sounds more serious. There were moments in his defeat by Kyrgios when the Australian almost knocked the racket from his right hand with his power-serving; few could recall that happening often in the same match.", "Djokovic, unable to defend his Miami title and the points that go with it, risks sliding quickly away from Murray in the rankings unless he can regroup on the clay of Europe.", "That anxiety could further eat into his confidence, which was stratospheric at the start of 2016. \u201cMy doctor has strongly advised against play because my elbow injury, that I keep carrying on for months, got worse in the past week,\u201d Djokovic announced on his Facebook page.", "\u201cSadly, I won\u2019t be able to defend my title in Miami this week. Believe me, it is as shocking to me, as it is to you.

", "Zverev takes the advantage but then there\u2019s probably the rally of the match, Federer brilliantly hitting two lobs, the first of which is hoiked back in by Zverev; the second, a dozen shots later, drops inside the line to give Federer the point. And that puts a bit of a pep into the Swiss \u2013 a fizzing cross court backhand gives him another break point, one he takes with a ludicrously good backhand down the line. Zverev, at the net on both occasions, can only watch on with admiration.", "Third set: Zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server)", "Zverev makes a rare excursion to the net on the Federer serve and gets passed for his troubles. Another utterly straightforward hold.", "Third set: *Zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server)", "It\u2019s all gone a little flat out on Rod Laver \u2013 the crowd have stopped believing in this as a contest, while Zverev has only sporadically suggested he believes in it himself.

The world No50 saves it with a ferocious serve and a controlled volley. Another excellent volley gives him the advantage and a point later he has the hold. It\u2019s far from straightforward for the German at the moment though.", "There\u2019s just something in the way he moves isn\u2019t there?

At 0-15 Federer sends a return skidding onto Zverev\u2019s toes and the big man can only dump the ball into the net. 0-30. And that soon becomes 0-40 as Federer gets the better of a close-quarters exchange at the net. Three break points. Federer needs just won, passing Zverev with ease as the German\u2019s volley sits up to be hit. Federer will serve for the second set.", "Second set: Zverev 1-6, 5-5 Federer* (*denotes server)", "So Federer serves to stay in the second set. Zverev seems content to sit at the back of the court on the Federer serve now, tempting Federer to attack the net. Which he does without success on this occasion \u2013 Zverev leads 15-30. A weak return from the German allows Federer to go cross-court for 30-30 a long return makes it 40-30, and an ace gives Federer the hold.", "Second set: *Zverev 1-6, 5-4 Federer (*denotes server)", "At 30-0 Federer misses with the most routine of forehands and an ace brings Zverev a routine hold.

Essentially the shape of the match is as follows \u2013 Zverev is at the net; if his approach shot is awkward for Federer then Zverev tends to win the point with a volley; if his approach shot is anything other than excellent then Federer wins with a passing shot or by sending a ferocious drive into the body of his opponent.", "Federer is also attacking the net on occasion \u2013 he does so at 30-0 but is beaten by a fine passing shot, then a long baseline rally \u2013 the longest of the match \u2013 ends with Federer netting a backhand.

A hold to love.", "Second set: Zverev 1-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server)", "This is better from Zverev, a cracking forehand down the line takes him 15-30 up on the Federer serve.

The pool must be fairly small.", "First set: Zverev 1-6 Federer* (*denotes server)", "That game ends a run of 18 (at least) straight games for Federer against this opponent. Zverev digs in for 30-30 but another straightforward winner gives Federer his first set point \u2026 but he makes a rare error, straying wide on his forehand.

He looked tentative from the off and now he looks shellshocked. Another volley off the frame at the net at least gives him a 15-0 lead this time and, after another Federer pass, an ace takes us to 30-15. Federer fails to return another booming serve but then a Zverev volley goes long \u2013 40-30.
